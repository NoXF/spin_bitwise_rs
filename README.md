spin_bitwise
===========

This Rust library implements a multiple-reader single-writer spinlock ([readers-writer lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writer_lock)) based on a single atomic construct.

On top of this, it implements a mechanism to obtain a set of simultaneous read/write locks in a all-or-none fashion.

## TODO

 - Merge this with [spin](https://github.com/mvdnes/spin-rs)
 - Merge this with [concurrent-hashmap](https://github.com/veddan/rust-concurrent-hashmap/blob/master/benches/concurrent.rs)
 - Create a separate set of tests. Currently all of the test checks are done in benchmarks.
 - Implement docs.

## Usage
See [examples](https://github.com/andreycizov/spin_bitwise_rs/tree/master/examples), or for more thorough usage patterns see [benches](https://github.com/andreycizov/spin_bitwise_rs/tree/master/benches).

### Single example

```rust
extern crate spin_bitwise;


fn main() {
    let lock = spin_bitwise::RwLock::new(0);
    
    // You may either generate a random reader id
    let reader_id = spin_bitwise::random_reader_idx();
    // Or you may supply a reader id from you own threading environment
    // But it must be less than `spin_bitwise::ARCH.reader_cnt`
    let reader_id = 0 % spin_bitwise::ARCH.reader_cnt;
    
    {
        let mut locked = lock.write();
        *locked = 2;
    }
    {
        let mut locked = lock.write();
        *locked += 2;
    }
    
    {
        let mut locked = lock.read(reader_id);
        
        println!("Value behind the lock is: {}", *locked);
    }
}

```

Prints

```
Value behind the lock is: 4
```

### Multi-locking example

```rust
extern crate spin_bitwise;


use std::collections::HashMap;
use spin_bitwise::{RwLock, random_reader_idx, ARCH};

fn main() {
    let total_locks = 6;
    let read_count = 3;
    let write_count = 2;
    
    let mut locks = HashMap::<u32, RwLock<u64>>::new();
    
    for idx in 0..total_locks {
        locks.insert(idx as u32, RwLock::new(0));
    }
    
    // You may either generate a random reader id
    let reader_id = random_reader_idx();
    // Or you may supply a reader id from you own threading environment
    // But it must be less than `spin_bitwise::ARCH.reader_cnt`
    let reader_id = 0 % ARCH.reader_cnt;
    
    // Make sure `read_locks` and `write_locks` do not overlap
    let read_locks = (0..read_count).map(|x| locks.get(&x).unwrap()).collect();
    let write_locks = (read_count..read_count + write_count).map(|x| locks.get(&x).unwrap()).collect();
    
    {
        let locked = RwLock::lock_many(reader_id, &read_locks, &write_locks);
        
        for mut x in locked.write {
            *x += 1;
            println!("Writing lock value: {}", *x);
        }
        
        for x in locked.read {
            println!("Accessing lock value: {}", *x);
        }
    }
    
    for x in 0..total_locks {
        let locked = locks.get(&x).unwrap().read(reader_id);
        println!("Key {} Value={}", x, *locked);
    }
}
```

Prints

```
Writing lock value: 1
Writing lock value: 1
Accessing lock value: 0
Accessing lock value: 0
Accessing lock value: 0
Key 0 Value=0
Key 1 Value=0
Key 2 Value=0
Key 3 Value=1
Key 4 Value=1
Key 5 Value=0
```

## Implementation

Based on the target platform, we are using a single atomic construct to allow us to have `(bit/2)-1` read locks and a `1` lock at the same time.

For example, for a 64-bit platform we are allowed to have `31` simultaneous readers and `1` writer.

We use an atomic xor and atomic or-get

## Benchmarks
### Run them yourself

```bash
cargo bench
```

### Reference
MB/s here is the number of operations per second.

bench_many implements a ring of N threads each writing to a single key and reading from N-1 keys.
